  <h1>🌍💚 Climate Justice: A Love Letter to the Planet & Its People 🌱✨</h1>
    <p>The Earth is speaking—through 🌪️ storms, 🔥 heatwaves, and 🌊 rising seas. But beneath the chaos is a powerful movement rising like the 🌞 morning sun: <strong style="color: blueviolet;">CLIMATE JUSTICE.</strong> 💪🌎
      It’s not just about carbon—it's about compassion. 💞
      Why should those who did the least to cause climate change suffer the most? 😢 From farmers in Kenya to islanders in the Pacific 🌺, climate justice says:      
     <i style="color: blueviolet;">“We see you. We stand with you. 🤝💚”</i> <br><br>

          <i>"We have the ability to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. But again, we’re forced to ask: Do we have the collective will? Because our success is not going to happen by accident. It won’t happen without sustained commitment, without cooperation and creative thinking. And it won’t happen without confident investors and innovative entrepreneurs. And it certainly won’t happen without leadership." ​</i>

          <i>"Africa contributes less than 3% of the pollution responsible for climate change but is most severely impacted by the ensuing crisis. It is therefore only fair and proper that this conference takes necessary measures to recognize Africa’s special needs and circumstances under the Paris Agreement, in line with the convention and relevant decisions adopted by previous COPs."</i>
